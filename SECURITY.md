## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, **please do not open a public issue**.

Instead, report it privately by using the **[GitHub Security Advisories](https://github.com/CogStack/cogstack-nlp/security/advisories)** for this repo

### Guidelines for Responsible Disclosure

- Do not publicly disclose details of the vulnerability until we have released a fix.
- Do not attempt to exploit the vulnerability beyond what is necessary to demonstrate it.
- Provide as much detail as possible (affected versions, reproduction steps, etc.) to help us triage the issue quickly.
