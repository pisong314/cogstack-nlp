## [example-medcat-v1-model-pack][(models/examples/example-medcat-v1-model-pack.zip)
- This model pack is built by running the MedCAT V1 Tutorial Part 3.1.
- https://github.com/CogStack/cogstack-nlp/blob/main/v1/medcat-tutorials/notebooks/introductory/Part_3_1_Building_a_Concept_Database_and_Vocabulary.ipynb

It isn't a trained model, but has the concepts "Kidney Failure" and "Failure of Kidneys" built in


## [example-deid-model-pack](models/examples/example-deid-model.zip)
- This is a deid model only for a single input text for testing.
- Only understands PATIENT for deid in very limited cases
- Trained using 10k synthetic data of just a few example sentences like "Patient {full} had been diagnosed with acute kidney failure the week before"
